In this game, the player controls a basket at the bottom of the screen. The main objective is to catch as many of the
good fruit falling from the ceiling and to dodge as many of the rotten fruit that also fall from the ceiling. If the 
player touches the rotten fruit, they lose a life. If the player fails to catch a good fruit, they also lose a life. The player
can press the spacebar to shoot a bullet that will destroy any rotten fruit that it encounters. The more times the rotten fruit
hits the floor, the probability of spawning more rotten fruit increases, endangering the player's lives. The probability of the 
rotten fruit's speed increases will also go up as more rotten fruit hit the floor, making the game increasingly challenging as 
time goes on.
